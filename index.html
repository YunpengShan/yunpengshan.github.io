    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio, my name is Yunpeng(Andre) Shan</h1>
    <h2>I'm a passionate Software Developer/Web Developer with great analytical skills</h2>
    <p>I am a current third-year Software Development & Network Engineering student at Sheridan College with a passion and aspiration for Software, Web, Data analysis. The process of completing projects and assignments makes me an excellent problem solver. This problem-solving skill gives me the ability to be a faster learner and it is crucial and helpful for the whole learning journey and furture job. I am currently looking for the opportunity of a COOP in Winter 2025 (Jan - Apr) and Seeking Full-Time Opportunities, I believe real work experiences are the best way to learn.</p>
